# Adventures-In-JS
A basic Javascript learning game


This is a game to help learn Javascript. If it goes well it may turn into a series of games. 
Each with a specific focus. This first one will be focused on working with arrays and objects.

The intended age range is probably teens and older.

It's supposed to have a "hacking" feel to it, to keep people engaged while they're learning.
